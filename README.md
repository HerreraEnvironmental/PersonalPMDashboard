### What is this repository for? ###

* This is a Shiny App template for Herrera to develop interactive tools to be hosted online and linked through Herrera's webiste. The User Interface (UI) is built to emulate Herrera external website by using HTML and CSS code lifted from the website.
* Version 0.1.0

### How do I get set up? ###

* @Regina can you provide instructions on how to branch this to retain the template but allow the developer to change the server / a portion of the UI regarding the display of the tool

### Contribution guidelines ###

* Ideally, we should track bugs and enhancement through "Issues," designate assignees, and have them implement pull requests.
